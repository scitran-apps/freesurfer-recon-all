  "description": "This gear takes an anatomical NIfTI file and performs all of the FreeSurfer cortical reconstruction process. Outputs are provided in a zip file and include the entire output directory tree from Recon-All. Configuration options exist for setting the subject ID and for converting outputs to NIfTI, OBJ, and CSV. FreeSurfer is a software package for the analysis and visualization of structural and functional neuroimaging data from cross-sectional or longitudinal studies. It is developed by the Laboratory for Computational Neuroimaging at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging.
